* add a makefile rule `shared` that:
    (perl because sed doesn't support lookaround assertions, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12176026/whats-wrong-with-my-lookahead-regex-in-gnu-sed)

    perl -pi -e 's/(?<=add_library\(${MAIN_TARGET_LIB})\s*STATIC\s*(?=${PTIMETRACKER_SRCS_NOT_MAIN}\))/SHARED/g' libtimetracker/CMakeLists.txt

    (might want to have perl write to a temp file and then use cmake -P ...)

-----------------------


* note: don't have to implement behavior to never insert rows with blank program name because the user would have to pass .* to get that behavior anyway
