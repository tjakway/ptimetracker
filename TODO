* break up TimeTracker.IO.Database into multiple files

* have setupDbMonad/runDbMonad do hslogger setup (and make sure it applies to the "DbMonad" logger!)
* add tick resolution -> DbData

-----------------------


* note: don't have to implement behavior to never insert rows with blank program name because the user would have to pass .* to get that behavior anyway
